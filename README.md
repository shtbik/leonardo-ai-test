# Leonardo AI Test

Hi there,

Thank you for taking the time to review my technical task. I found the requirements quite easy to follow and didn't have any major questions. I enjoyed building the app as it covers multiple areas of real web applications, including basic authentication. I'm excited to get your feedback and hope to catch up with you soon.

Disclaimer

- The last time I worked with NextJS was 3.5 years ago when the 10th version was available. While I remember some of the principles of the framework, I had to review the documentation to complete the task. There is definitely room for optimization and I kindly ask you to take this into consideration.
- I have put effort into making my code production-ready, but please take this with a grain of salt. Below is a list of what I would do before launching this for customers:
  - Implement more efficient rendering (e.g. fetching data on the server for the initial list of cards, pre-fetch images)
  - Add unit and e2e tests
  - Write cleaner code with more granulated components and types
  - Generate types based on the API
  - And many more
